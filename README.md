# Collatz Sequence Explorer

This is a small project built with **HTML** and **JavaScript** to explore the **Collatz sequence** — a famous mathematical sequence where any positive integer eventually reaches 1 through a specific set of rules.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of a bootcamp homework assignment.  
The goal was to gain deeper understanding of loops, conditionals, and working with arrays in JavaScript, while also solving a well-known algorithmic problem.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- JavaScript

## 🔍 How It Works

- The user is prompted to enter a limit number.  
- The script finds the number under that limit which produces the **longest Collatz sequence**.  
- It then displays the result and the full sequence in the browser console.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Looping and logic flow in JavaScript  
- Basic user input handling with `prompt()`  
- Storing and comparing sequences in arrays  
- Real-life application of algorithmic thinking

## ⚠️ Note

All output is displayed in the browser console.  
Open Developer Tools (F12) to view the results.

## 👀 Why This Project Matters

Though it’s a simple script, it reflects a hands-on attempt to **blend coding logic with mathematical curiosity.**  
This kind of small project sharpens problem-solving and deepens core JS understanding.
